abstract="Gaussian process regression (GPR) is one of the non-parametric methods and has been studied in many fields to construct a prediction model for highly non-linear system. It has been difficult to apply it to a real-time task due to its high computational cost but recent high-performance computers and computationally efficient algorithms make it possible. In our previous work, we derived a fast approximation method for GPR using a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) and product of experts model, but its performance depends on the parameters of the hash functions used in LSH. Hash functions are usually determined randomly. In this research, we propose an optimization method for the parameters of hash functions by referring to a swarm optimization method. The experimental results show that accurate force estimation of an actual robotic arm is achieved with high computational efficiency.",

abstract="In recent years, privacy-preserving data mining has been studied extensively, because of the wide proliferation of sensitive information on the internet. A number of algorithmic techniques have been designed for privacy-preserving data mining. In this paper, we provide a review of the state-of-the-art methods for privacy. We discuss methods for randomization, k-anonymization, and distributed privacy-preserving data mining. We also discuss cases in which the output of data mining applications needs to be sanitized for privacy-preservation purposes. We discuss the computational and theoretical limits associated with privacy-preservation over high dimensional data sets.",

The usual choice of a one dimensional B space fails for a high dimensional L space because this ratio is then low. If the dimensionality of B is about half that of L the equivalent of no more than 75% of the full distance computations need be done, independent of the dimensionality of L space. If the variance in B space can be increased by either sorting or the principal components transformation performance is appreciably better.},
