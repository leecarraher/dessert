%% this is a general purpose outline for preparing your thesis.  do not rigidly
%% follow this; feel free to discuss alternate structures with me.  your work
%% may have unique features that should be treated accordingly.  this template
%% that sets up the latex formatting and that contains my comments on the main
%% structures/paragraphs that you should develop for a masters or phd thesis.
%% the cover page is setup for a masters thesis; it is easily adjusted for a phd
%% dissertation.

%% as you can probably guess, in latex the ``%'' sign starts a comment, for some
%% reason i got in the habit of using two for main comments like this and have
%% done so ever since.  the comment goes to the end of the line.

%% to build this you will have to install the standard latex packages (if you
%% want to use the machine in my office that works.  the basic build command
%% sequence is (assuming the main latex file is titled ``thesis.tex''):

%% pdflatex thesis
%% bibtex thesis
%% pdflatex thesis
%% pdflatex

%% you do not actually need to do all four every time, but whenever you change
%% the citations/references file, you will have to go through the complete
%% sequence to have all labels resolve (basically latex is a one-pass system
%% that uses files to record references for use in later passes.

%% the way i've set this up, you will create your main prose in this file
%% (thesis.tex), your references will go in the bibtex file (refs.bib, i have
%% set yours up with my version for the parallel simulation literature) and your
%% figures should be stored as pdf in the figs subdirectory.  there are online
%% tutorials and books available to help you (i would stick to the online
%% stuff).  i can also help you resolve some things.  i will give you a quick
%% tutorial on the use of latex below (by example).

%% SOME COMMENTS ON THESIS WRITING

%% as you write your thesis, remember that this is a formal document; it is a
%% story and it should be interesting, but it should *not* be informal.  the
%% prose should be in 3rd person (no ``I'' or ``we'').  each paragraph should
%% stay in the same tense (prefereably present tense), and USE ACTIVE VOICE.

%% also, you will have to repeat yourself much more than you are confortable
%% with.  your writing has to carry the reader, you literally have to lead them
%% through your chapters.  you *will* end up restating things that you think are
%% obvious.  each chapter will have to begin with an intro to remind the reader
%% where you are going to take them (they will forget).  it is not obvious to
%% them, you have to explain.

%% remember, however, that it is a story, it is a technical story, but
%% none-the-less, you are developing an idea and you want potential readers to
%% pay attention to your prose.  make it a story that flows.  

%% each paragraph should focus on one topic and you may need to have transitions
%% between the paragraphs to help the reader make the transition through your
%% discussion.  generally you don't really have to do much to support
%% transistions.  develop your paragraph structure to present a coherent thought
%% from the topic sentence to the final sentence (of the paragraph).  most of
%% the time this will naturally lead you to the subsequent paragraph.  so in the
%% end, it *is* a story that is easy to read.

%% no contractions, ever!!  write formally, no ``something gets'' instead write
%% ``something obtains'', think about your wording.  use exactly the word you
%% want at each place in the prose; think about the subtle different definitions
%% similar words, ``between'' and ``among'' have drastically different meanings;
%% so do ``complex'' and ``complicated''.  be sure you understand the
%% differences.  you will live with a dictionary (online or on paper) as you
%% write this thesis, you will be surprised at how much you really don't know
%% about a word's real definition (you'd be surprised to know how much i still
%% use a dictionary).  finally, think about your words, expand your writing
%% vocabulary.  it can be really rewarding to write very good prose (and your
%% mechanics of writing are already solid).  what makes good writing superior is
%% the vocabulary and consistency.

%% be consistent!!  this is biggly important.  when you name something use the
%% same naming throughout; don't call something a subsystem in one chapter and a
%% subassembly in another.  select a name for your thing (e.g., signing device,
%% simulation object, etc) and stick with it throughout.  there is nothing more
%% confusing and offputting than to have the writer use multiple phrases to
%% refer to the same thing.  consistency is critical.  i could go on and on, but
%% let's stop here for now.

%% some more general comments:

%% 1. citations should have a preceeding space space use ``citation \cite{foo}''
%%    instead of ``citation\cite{foo}''.

%% 2. if you have a figure/table in the document, it must be discussed in the
%%    prose and you cannot simply say ``see \ref{pseudocode}'';  you must use
%%    the object name, such as ``see Figure \ref{pseudocode}'' (also capitalize
%%    the object name.
